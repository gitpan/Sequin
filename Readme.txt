If you want to use Sequin in a CGI script, that you're either going
to distribute or sell, you are able to simply lift the main
subroutine from the module, and put it at the bottom of your script.
However, there are three conditions for doing this. Firstly, you ask
my permission. I will almost without exception say yes, so email me
at 'sargie@hotmail.com'. I should reply within about 24 hours.
Secondly, a sentence giving me credit for the subroutine *IS*
not only required under the license, but is common courtesy. Finally,
I'd like a copy of the script it's used in. I understand this may not
be possible in all cases, but I'd like to know why not if not.

If, you're going to use the module purely for personal use, I'd be
fascinated to see where you're using it and how you're using it, but,
you're not forced to tell me or show me.

Stay happy,
Peter Sergeant
